## Implementation Order
1. Start with `GenesisTriad` struct in `src/triangle/genesis.rs`
2. Implement basic triangle validation in `src/triangle/validation.rs`
3. Create mining algorithm in `src/mining.rs`
4. Build transaction system in `src/transaction.rs`
5. Implement network layer in `src/network.rs`

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for geometric calculations
- Integration tests for mining workflow
- Property-based testing for triangle relationships
- Benchmark tests for performance optimization
