# Sierpinski Cryptocurrency - Continuation Plan

## Current Sprint: Core Cryptographic Implementation

### Sprint Goal
Complete the foundational cryptographic functions and triangle state management to enable basic mining and transaction capabilities.

### Sprint Tasks (Next 2 weeks)

#### Week 1: Cryptographic Foundation
1. **Complete src/crypto.rs**
   - Implement FractalHasher with SHA3 integration
   - Add triangle coordinate hashing
   - Create geometric proof verification
   - Add fractal property validation

2. **Enhance src/triangle/state.rs**
   - Complete TriangleState enum
   - Add state transition logic
   - Implement persistence layer

#### Week 2: Mining & Transactions
3. **Create src/mining.rs**
   - FractalProofOfWork implementation
   - Geometric puzzle generation
   - Difficulty adjustment algorithm

4. **Complete src/transaction.rs**
   - Transaction embedding in triangles
   - Geometric validation
   - Multi-triangle support

### Technical Specifications
- **Hash Algorithm**: SHA3-256 with fractal properties
- **Coordinate Precision**: 256-bit fixed-point arithmetic
- **State Storage**: Merkle tree-based persistence
- **Mining Algorithm**: Geometric proof-of-work with fractal complexity

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all geometric calculations
- Integration tests for state transitions
- Property-based testing for fractal algorithms
- Benchmarking for mining performance

### Dependencies
- Add `sha3 = "0.10"` to Cargo.toml
- Add `serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }`
- Add `tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }`

### Definition of Done
- All cryptographic functions implemented and tested
- Triangle state management complete with persistence
- Basic mining algorithm functional
- Transaction system foundation in place
- 90%+ test coverage on core modules
